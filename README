PLEASE NOTE I've imported this repository to GitHub because I still receive
requests related to it. I do not intend to further maintain it actively. If
you are interested in working on the code I will happily give you full access
to the repository, just drop me a note (svenfuchs@artweb-design.de or send me
a GitHub message). I also might help you out with advise or pointers but I
sadly can not invest tons of time into it.

h1. Mephisto Paged Article Lists

Mephisto doesn't page article lists out of the box. This plugin adds that.

Depends on will_paginate_liquidized
